This glossary contains key terms related to the DeepSC project and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).

## Biology

| **Term**  | **Definition**  | **Ontology Link** |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Single-Cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-seq) | A technology that allows the study of gene expression at the single-cell level, providing insights into cellular heterogeneity and biological processes. | [EFO_0005684](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/efo/terms?short_form=EFO_0005684) |
| Transcriptomics | The study of RNA transcripts produced by the genome, including their expression levels, structures, and functions. | [EFO_0002770](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/efo/terms?short_form=EFO_0002770) |
| Foundation Model | A deep learning model trained on a large dataset that can be adapted to various downstream tasks, such as cell-type classification or disease prediction. | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_model) |


## General

|-----------|----------------|------------------|


## Cells

| **Term**  | **Definition**  | **Ontology Link** |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Cell Type | A classification of cells based on their structure, function, and gene expression profile. In scRNA-seq, different cell types can be identified based on their transcriptomic signatures. | [CL Ontology](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/cl) |


## Diseases

| **Term**  | **Definition**  | **Ontology Link** |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Cancer | A disease characterized by uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation, often studied using scRNA-seq to understand tumor heterogeneity. | [DOID_162](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/doid/terms?short_form=DOID_162) |
| Neurodegenerative Diseases | Conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease that result from the progressive degeneration of the nervous system. scRNA-seq helps in identifying affected cell types and molecular pathways. | [DOID_1289](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/doid/terms?short_form=DOID_1289) |


## Organs

| **Term**  | **Definition**  | **Ontology Link** |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Liver | A vital organ involved in metabolism, detoxification, and protein synthesis. Transcriptomic studies help understand liver function and diseases such as cirrhosis. | [UBERON_0002107](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/uberon/terms?short_form=UBERON_0002107) |


## Genes

| **Term**  | **Definition**  | **Ontology Link** |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Gene Expression | The process by which genetic information is used to synthesize proteins or RNA molecules, crucial for cell function and identity. | [GO_0010467](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/go/terms?short_form=GO_0010467) |
| Regulatory Genes | Genes that control the expression of other genes, playing a key role in development, differentiation, and disease. | [GO_0006355](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/go/terms?short_form=GO_0006355) |
| Mutations | Changes in the DNA sequence that can have neutral, beneficial, or harmful effects on an organism. In diseases like cancer, mutations can drive tumor progression. | [SO_0001059](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/so/terms?short_form=SO_0001059) |
